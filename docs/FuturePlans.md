## The future of project-origin
This project is a seed for a far-reaching vision. In the future, it should allow developing a wide variety of universes. Below are some examples of future capabilities of project-origin:

- project-origin should allow extending the physics of the environment easily and maybe incorporate realistic physical simulators.
- It should support morphology of creatures, i.e. to give physical shape to creatures, that may affect their capabilities such as movement speed, power, etc.
- It should support the introduction of different inanimated and non-intelligent living objects with a variety of functionalities and behavior to the universe, e.g. poison.
- While currently, space is a 2-D, in the future it should allow supporting different types of spaces.
- Easily controlling biological aspects of physics such as mating rule, evolution, and intelligence inheritance.
- It should allow extending the creature's capabilities, such as adding vocal communication and even love, hate, and motivation.
- It should allow defining dynamic natures, like periods of dearth and epidemics. 
- Use dynamic graph deep learning framework such as TensorFlow 2.0 or Pytorch.
- Use openAI baselines and/or Google dopamine projects as an implementation of the creature brain. 
- Using Unity or other engines, implement a visual simulation environment. 
- Add morphology and form to creatures that define its biological and physical features.


## Far-reaching plans and directions
- Model selection and hyper-parameter tuning. Show that Convolutional can better survive than fully connected layers.
- Special relation between individuals based on graph networks to process the relationship between individuals.
- Hebbian Learning vs. Gradient-based in a survival environment. Which is better? 
- Develop a game platform which allow training of a race and then allow it compete over resources with different race.
- compare between the different implementation of RL algorithms, model-based and model-free, policy gradient and TD learning.
