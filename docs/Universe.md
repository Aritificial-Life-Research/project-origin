## Universe

In each experiment, there is a single Universe, which the simulator engine instantiate and run.
The main functionality of the Universe is to give the opportunity for each creature in the grid to perform an action.
The Universe responses to the action, and changes accordingly.
It also changes the acting creature internal state and maybe other affected creatures, depending on the action.
