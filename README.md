# Project "life"
### A simulation of the universe

Today, when we think about Artificial Intelligence (AI) what we have in mind is machine learning models and heuristics to solve problems that are complex enough that their solution cannot be written using an exact set of steps but should be learned from data or from interaction with the environment.
In this narrow view, AI is a collection of procedures that can be seen as a smart extension of functions (in classical computer programs) that we can be used to make our life easier.
However, contemplating the term artificial intelligence one appreciates the fact that it actually means much more. 
It may refer to Intelligent creatures or subjects that live in some universe and want to survive using their intelligence and skills.

Depending on the universe rules and physics they live in, these creatures may develop complicated skills and even collaborations and maybe would need a system of communication.
*In addition to the thrill of developing intelligent creators, we as humans can observe the behavior of these creatures and maybe learn something about ourselves.*

Similar to a reinforcement algorithm learning to play Atari 2600 games, an algorithm (a model) may be able to learn how to survive and flourish in a given environment. 
Universes are environments that creatures live in, adapt to and succeed.
Different universes may have different rules which we call physics. 
The creatures may have different senses and a different set of actions.
It is interesting to see how different intelligence can be developed under different physics.
Intelligence may be affected and controlled not only by the environment physics but also by the creature physical structure, sensors, and actions.

life is the first attempt to develop such an environment to allow investigating how intelligence may be developed under a specific physics.
How it can learn to survive and react to signals from the environment using reinforcement learning.

The **"life"** universe is made simple without complex rules and with no graphics, however, it is built and visioned to be easy to imagine.
life has all the aspect that any universe has: Space, time, physics and chance.
Space is called the *Grid* and is implemented as a matrix of *Cells*.
Each cell can contain objects such as creatures, food, etc.
The physics (rules), time and chance are controlled by the universe. The universe also reacts to the actions of the creatures under the laws of physics. 

The creatures in life are called "Mangos", viz. "Mango" is the name of their race.
Mangos may have private names which must have the "mango" prefix. 
For instance, "mangolid", "mangodo" and "mangodino" are all valid names for mangos.

While still have no morphology and form, mangos have a brain, sensors and set of actions.
At each time step, they see their surrounding environment and select an action.
The creatures can move in the grid, eat, mate and fight.
Their destiny is controlled by the universe physics, but mainly by their intelligence which dictates their actions, interactions and skills.


## Research Questions
The scientific question this simulation aims at is the following: 
**Can we create intelligent creatures that can develop survival skills such as collaboration and communication?**
Namely, being put in a challenging environment, can the state of the art AI, using trial and error and evolution, 
learn how to survive?
Can it figure out complex behavior, from the procedural and social viewpoints, if that is required to their survival?  
Would they learn using their actions (moving, mating, and producing sound) and "understand" the effect of the these actions on
their own survival and on the environment? 
Would they develop non-obvious behavior showing their understanding on the effect of time and age? 

Answering these questions, by demonstrating how complicated skills can be developed by artificial agents in a simulation
would shed some light and take us closer toward understanding the mechanics and the true nature of our intelligence.
It may even reveal some insights about more abstract nature and skills that animal and humans posses, like socializing, communication and even love. 

For instance, assume that the physics of the simulation dictates that two creatures should be in specific place and perform 
a specific operation simultaneously in order to both get reward, would they learn to do so?
Another example, if the physics of the environment, that doing an action in a specific age or a specific time cycle of the universe, 
could result in a great reward, would make them "wait" to this age to do the action?
