## A simulation of the universe

Today, when we think about artificial intelligence (AI) we mean mainly complex models and heuristics to solve problems that are complex enough that their solution cannot be written using exact set of steps but should be learned from data and from interaction with the environment.
In this narrow view machine learning and AI are just smart functions that we can be used to make our life easier.
However thinking deeply about the term Artificial intelligence one appreciates the fact that it may mean much more. It may refer to Intelligent creatures or subjects that live in some universe and want to survive using their intelligence.
Depending on the universe rules and physics they may develop complicated skills and even collaborations and a system of communication.
In addition to the thrill of developing intelligent creators, we can observe their behavior and maybe learning something about ourselves.

Similar to a reinforcement algorithm learning to play Atari games an algorithm (a model) may be able to learn how to survive and flourish in a given environment. 
Universes are environments that creatures live in, adapt to and succeed.
Different universes may have different rules which we call physics. 
The creates may have different senses and a different set of actions.
It is interesting to see how different intelligence can be developed under different physics.
Intelligence may be affected and controlled not only by the environment physics but also by the creature physical structure, sensors and actions.

life is the first attempt to develop such environment to allow investigating how intelligence may be developed under a specific physics.
How it can learn to survive and react to signals from the environment using reinforecement learning.
